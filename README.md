# discord-bot
Playing around with the new discord-bot api for nodejs. 

# Purpose
Discord already provides some default bots with a limited list of triggerable audio soundbites but I wanted to have an easy way to upload more. The project logs into an existing discord account and listens for !commands and also spools up a simple (unstylized for now) site that allows for mp3 uploads to create new soundbite commands. 

## Install Pre Reqs

$ sudo apt-get install build-essential
